# white-box-vision

The goal of the white box vision library is to test vision models for interpretability, attribution, and visualization, with a focus on the vision transformer. The goal of the library is to enable interactive exploration of a pre-trained model in a notebook, and conduct ablation experiments on intermediate representations and how a model builds its prediction. 


This library was based on Nora Belrose's whitebox library (https://github.com/norabelrose/white-box), but has been refactored for vision models.
